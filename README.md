# pip-update

pip-update is a simple tool written in (hopefully) portable shell that will update all pip installed projects.


It doesn't aim to provide any fancy options or features, it has no command line arguments, and it doesn't aim to grow any.


# Installation

Copy this file to somewhere in your $PATH. For a system-wide install /usr/local/bin is a good choice, for a per user install ~/.local/bin is a good choice. You may need to add that your path.
